Basic Core Programs
1. Flip Coin and print percentage of Heads and Tails
a. I/P -> The number of times to Flip Coin. Ensure it is a positive integer.
b. Logic -> Use Random Function to get value between 0 and 1. If < 0.5 then tails or
heads
c. O/P -> Percentage of Head vs Tails
2. Leap Year
a. I/P -> Year, ensure it is a 4 digit number.
b. Logic -> Determine if it is a Leap Year.
c. O/P -> Print the year is a Leap Year or not.
3. Power of 2
a. Desc -> This program takes a command-line argument N and prints a table of the
powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^N.
b. I/P -> The Power Value N. Only works if 0 <= N < 31 since 2^31 overflows an int
c. Logic -> repeat until i equals N.
d. O/P -> Print the year is a Leap Year or not.
4. Harmonic Number
a. Desc -> Prints the Nth harmonic number: 1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/N
(http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~chvatal/notes/harmonic.html).
b. I/P -> The Harmonic Value N. Ensure N != 0
c. Logic -> compute 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/N
d. O/P -> Print the Nth Harmonic Value.
5. Factors
a. Desc -> Computes the prime factorization of N using brute force.
b. I/P -> Number to find the prime factors
c. Logic -> Traverse till i*i <= N instead of i <= N for efficiency.
d. O/P -> Print the prime factors of number N.

6. Java Program to Compute Quotient and Remainder
7. Java Program to Swap Two Numbers
8. Java Program to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd
9. Java Program to Check Whether an Alphabet is Vowel or Consonant
10. Java Program to Find the Largest Among Three Numbers

Functional Programs

1. 2D Array
a. Desc -> A library for reading in 2D arrays of integers, doubles, or booleans from
standard input and printing them out to standard output.
b. I/P -> M rows, N Cols, and M * N inputs for 2D Array. Use Java Scanner Class
c. Logic -> create 2 dimensional array in memory to read in M rows and N cols
d. O/P -> Print function to print 2 Dimensional Array. In Java use PrintWriter with
OutputStreamWriter to print the output to the screen.

2. Sum of three Integer adds to ZERO
a. Desc -> A program with cubic running time. Read in N integers and counts the
number of triples that sum to exactly 0.
b. I/P -> N number of integer, and N integer input array
c. Logic -> Find distinct triples (i, j, k) such that a[i] + a[j] + a[k] = 0
d. O/P -> One Output is number of distinct triplets as well as the second output is to
print the distinct triplets.

3. Write a program Distance.java that takes two integer command-line arguments x
and y and prints the Euclidean distance from the point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0). The
formulae to calculate distance = sqrt(x*x + y*y). Use Math.power function
4. Write a program Quadratic.java to find the roots of the equation a*x*x + b*x + c.
Since the equation is x*x, hence there are 2 roots. The 2 roots of the equation
can be found using a formula (Note: Take a, b and c as input values)
delta = b*b - 4*a*c
Root 1 of x = (-b + sqrt(delta))/(2*a)
Root 2 of x = (-b - sqrt(delta))/(2*a)
5. Write a program WindChill.java that takes two double command-line arguments t
and v and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Given the
temperature t (in Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the
National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) to be:

Note: the formula is not valid if t is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger
than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).
